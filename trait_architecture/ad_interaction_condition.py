"""Exact local attraction--defence interaction condition for the regime model.

This module derives the mixed second derivative of the implemented qualitative
fitness score with respect to attraction ``A`` and defence ``D``.  It is an exact
statement for :func:`trait_architecture.model.fitness`, not a claim about an
empirical covariance, selection gradient, or natural-system effect size.

A positive mixed partial means that, locally in the declared score, increasing
one investment raises the marginal score of the other (complementarity).  A
negative value means local substitutability.  This is distinct from the sign of
covariance among grid optima, which remains a simulation outcome.
