# Initial broad real-world evidence harvest v2

## Retrieval receipt

The broad corpus is a **versioned live bibliographic retrieval**, not a frozen
local database snapshot. Each GitHub Actions artifact is therefore the complete
receipt for one run, including query report, deduplicated candidate CSV, and
screen summary.

The first completed run returned:

```text
source:                  Crossref REST API
query routes:            21
requested depth:         200 journal-article records per query
raw returned records:    4,183
unique DOI/title records: 2,896
records with abstract metadata: 1,008
priority shallow screen:   650
```

The next completed regeneration returned:

```text
raw returned records:    4,187
unique DOI/title records: 2,898
records with abstract metadata: 1,010
priority shallow screen:   657
```

This small difference is expected from a live provider's ranking and metadata
updates. No run silently overwrites the previous receipt. Exact counts used in
an analysis must be reported with the artifact digest, query report, and run
date from that analysis run.

This is deliberately larger than the fixed 258-work OpenAlex snapshot. The two
corpora have different roles and must not be silently combined.

```text
fixed_258_OpenAlex_v1
    immutable, reproducible study-design/identifiability audit

broad_reality_evidence_v2_Crossref_seed
    high-recall real-world evidence discovery and shallow source-coding universe
```

## Route coverage in the latest regenerated raw corpus

A record can occur in more than one route because source query membership is
retained rather than arbitrarily assigned.

```text
A_to_pollination:  929
A_to_antagonism:   584
B_to_antagonism:   606
B_to_pollination:  385
joint_channels:  1,073
```

These counts are **query-route memberships**, not counts of studies that
measured or supported the corresponding biological pathway.

## Why a second shallow screen is necessary

Crossref bibliographic queries correctly increase recall but also retrieve
non-biological uses of terms such as "flower", "pollination", or "trichome".
Examples include optimization algorithms, flower-like catalysts, and clinical
or human reproductive records.

A deterministic metadata screen therefore retains the raw corpus and labels
records as:

```text
priority_for_shallow_source_coding
biological_context_needs_route_screen
metadata_context_uncertain
likely_nonbiological_retrieval_noise
```

The priority class needs all of:

```text
- at least two biological flower-context terms in title/container metadata;
- an A or B metadata trait signal;
- a P, H, or W metadata outcome signal;
- no obvious non-biological exclusion term.
```

The latest regenerated run selected **657** priority records. This is a triage
set, not a final eligible-study set and not a collection of effect sizes.

## Next analysis layer

The priority cohort is used for shallow source coding:

```text
study × route × trait class × outcome class
reported sign: positive / negative / mixed / null / not reported
observational / manipulation / comparative / review
accessibility and quantitative-effect availability
```

Only later, separately, are compatible numerical effect strata pooled. The
initial broad corpus is already useful even if many records stop at sign or
design coding: it maps real-world support, contradiction, and missing channels
against the Part I robustness map.
